- Welcome to @HankrSamples, Within this profile there will samples of my code developed during my Game Development Course at University in the UK.
All of these codes are samples and prototypes of potentially bigger projects later in the future. 
Most of the codes display C++ Object Oreintated Programming, most are buggy and not fully optimised.
I am fully open to suggestions, criticsm and advice.
